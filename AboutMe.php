		<p><br>Welcome to my website <a href="http://blessedregina.org">Blessed Regina</a> !</p>
		<p><img src="INC/IMG/BlessedReginaAboutMe.jpg" width="360px"></p>
		<p>My name is Regina Hong and I'm the owner and the creator of this website. My full time job other than a Mystic, a Spiritualist, an Artist, an Entrepreuner, a Crafter, and a Poet was an Application Developer for a long time. I am something else now, but I still program as a hobby and PHP is one of my favorite language at the moment. You can check out About Me section of my other websites like <a href="http://truthofbible.com">Truth of Bible</a>, <a href="http://artbyreginahong.com">Art by Regina Hong</a> and <a href="http://imadeyouacard.com">I made you a card</a>. I don't think I'll make any more websites but who knows... :)</p>
		<p>By now, you might have figured out that I am quite a nerd. I call myself 'Super Nerdy' and I adore that part of me very much. That super nerdy part of me created this website and I'm going to keep on developing to add more functionalities to satisfy my desire of wanting to know the truth of the bible in ancient Hebrew. The rate and speed of knowledge being shared around the world doesn't really apply to Biblical Hebrew. At one point, I thought about how the Bible is going to disappear into the realm of artificial intelligence in near future and get lost in the realm of Science. Not that I have a religious point of view from Christianity or Catholic, I think it will be sad to lose the Bible. Sad, in a sense that we lost something that held a great value at some point of time in our history, but I also agree that it is creating much more problems. It is a complicated and complex topic to talk about, not to mention the sensitivity around the subject.</p>
		<p>I created this website to aid me in studying Biblical Hebrew. I challenged myself in being ambitious with Big Data and Open Source technology to create and develop something that can be shared with people to aid in pursuing and seeking the real truth of the bible. Without any personal agenda but from the pure curiosity and desire of wanting to know the truth... (I'm wondering now after I wrote that sentence if any curiosity or desire can be pure.) Knowing is one thing and understanding is another thing. In this Google and Big Data Era, the possibility of discovery is endless like that heart of God, our Creator.</p>
		<p>I am writing this in the middle of my journey and I don't know where I will land. I just remember answering a recruiter, when he asked me where I see myself in 5 years of time, that I think I would have created something that doesn't exist now. Oh yes I am ambitious. This might be a challenge that I may not be able to achieve, but that's what makes this journey exciting and adventurous and gives a whole lot more meaning to my life.</p>
		<p>There are lots of things to explore on this website including my blog. I hope you enjoy your discovery and please don't hesitate to be a part of this exciting adventure if you have a calling. You can contact me by email <a href="mailto:sunghee.regina.hong@gmail.com">sunghee.regina.hong@gmail.com</a>.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Regina Hong<br></p>
